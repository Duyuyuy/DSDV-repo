        <h2>PART 1</h2>
        <h1>The Production Tactics</h1>
        <p>
            <br>Over the span of 7 years, the number of Netflix's movie releases has experienced a 
            greater rate of change compared to that of TV Show releases.
            The trend hinted that the brand has made more investment in movies production and purchases.
            <br>
            <br>
            The data also suggests that Netflix has been focusing on generating  TV-MA and TV- 14  
            labeled contents, which can further infer that the brand’s target audience is 
            adolescent and adults (above 14 years old).

        <h2>PART 2</h2>
        <h1>The Duration Distribution</h1>
        <p>
            <br>The data illustrates that the distribution for Netflix movies’ length centered 
            around 100 minutes. The number can be seen as the prefered duration for viewers to
            enjoy to a movie. Therefore, to optimize the production cost and quality, 
            Netflix opted for movie with the time duration fall between 80 to 120 minute.
            <br>
            <br>
            The same goes for TV shows, which are mainly lasted for  one or two seasons.

        <h2>PART 3</h2>
        <h1>The Movie Update Strategy</h1>
        <p>
            <br>The number of new films released each year is gradually increasing, yet it is still 
            insufficient to match viewers demand.
            <br>
            <br>
            Therefore, Netflix relies on user preferences to discover and update popular films 
            from previous years (old) to the system's movie list. The line graph suggested that 
            the increase rate of old movies is faster than that of the new ones, 
            which are produced in the year they are added to Netflix. This allows subscribers to 
            enjoy old classic films while waiting for new Netflix originals.
            <br><br>
            This strategy not only keeps users engaged, but it also refreshes and diversifies the content, with genres ranging from cartoons to horror and from classic to modern.

        <h1>The Global Expansion Direction</h1>
        <p>
            <br>
            Creative studios have a lot to gain by adopting a global content strategy in our linked digital world, where the internet allows 
            stories to freely flow across state lines, nations, and oceans. Netflix has expanded its business market and now has a global presence in
             many countries. Thanks to the development of subtitles, local-language content is promoted and made available to foreign audiences without 
             language barriers. As a result of globalization, Netflix now offers movies from countries other than the United States, particularly Asian countries.
